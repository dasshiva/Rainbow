# Rainbow 
The Rainbow programming language is a simple language that aims\
to be powerful and stocked with features. It has only 3 data types\
namely - int (for integers eg. 109, 89 etc.), decimal(for floating point numbers eg. 3.14 , 7.84) and string for storing text (eg. Hello World) \
Each Rainbow program is written in a file having a .rbow extension. It consists of one or more statements that perform a fixed set of actions.\

## Statements 
As mentioned above a Rainbow lang program is a collection of statements having a definite purpose. Each "statement" has the following syntax: \
``
STATEMENT-TYPE ARGS
``
Here, "STATEMENT-TYPE" refers to any statement type which describes what that statement actually does and "ARGS" refer to arguements that are given to the keyword. For example :\
``
Set int a 4
``
Here the statement type is "Set" (i.e it is a statement that sets the value of a variable) and everything following it are the arguements
to Set. This statememt basically initializes a variable by the name 'a' to the value 4. One more thing to note about Rainbow's statements are that they must not span to 2 lines i.e each statement must end in a single line because the language assumes that each line is one single statement. \
