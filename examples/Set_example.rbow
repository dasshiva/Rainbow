# This program demonstrates the use of the Set statement
# This statement either creates a new variable or changes
# the value of an already declared variable depending on
# the arguements passed to it.
# For example, this creates a variable called 'a' of type 'int'
# and sets its value to 10

Set int a 10
Println "Current value of a is : " a

# Once we have declared the variable 'a' we can change its value
# to 12 by the following syntax

Set a 12
Print "Value of a now is : " a
